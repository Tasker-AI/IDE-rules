# Project Rules
- Always update existing files instead of making new ones
- Document all features and changes in the Project Functions section of this file when they are implemented or changed

# Project Functions (This is just an example, and should be updated by the Project architecture assistant)
- `Example function` is used to fetch `example data` using the `example.py` file

# Project Structure
- Always review the `project-structure.md` file before making any plans or creating any files
- Always ensure that files are placed in the correct location within the structure
- Always update the `project-structure.md` file whenever you introduce, rename, or remove a folder
- Keep related code together
- Use consistent file organization
- Maintain a flat structure where possible
- Group by feature rather than type
