# Planning Prompt

Create plain-text checklists (.md) for each new chunk of work.

```md
- Always review the `project-rules.md` file before making any plans
- We are in the process of building the project described in `project-rules.md` and `project-structure.md`
- Please create a new plan for implementing <your feature or change>
- Look around the repo and past checklists to understand the current project
- Then create a .md checklist with ~20 items that will allow us to make the most progress towards finishing the current phase
- Keep the items simple and use max 2 layers of hierarchy. Do not put in any code snippets
```
